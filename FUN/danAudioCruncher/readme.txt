This file patches Dan's audio files, turning them into the crunchy ones MikePanoots used! (I think they're the same, at least)

Remember to unzip the difference folder!

You'll need to copy these Dan files into the input folder, and then run the .exe (or the .py if you prefer):
	1TO3.1
	3TO6.1
	6TO9.1
	9TO12.1
	12TO15.1
	15TO18.1
	18TO21.1
(these should come with the game, but you might need to use 7zip to see them)

Afterwards, you'll get them back in the output folder (as lowercase files to avoid confusion)
