The "daninput" folder should contain the following files (which can be extracted from Down Under Dan with 7zip or equivalent):
	1TO3.1
	3TO6.1
	6TO9.1
	9TO12.1
	12TO15.1
	15TO18.1
	18TO21.1
	BACK.1
	IM.1
	MISC.1
	MUST.1
	OBJVOC.1
	PLTA.1
	RIVA.1
	RIVB.1
	SHER.1
	SO.1

(and if you have a demo file, maybe SPEECH.0, but you'll need to add that to the list in dan_1_file_extractor.py)

Once you use the .1 file extractor, you can use the unencoder to read the contents of SO.1's .ENC files.
