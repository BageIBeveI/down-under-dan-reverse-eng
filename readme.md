### OVERVIEW

This repository will consist mainly of info on Down Under Dan's code (instructions, enums, structs, memory, & whatever else seems to be a good fit).

It would be nice if all of this could lead to a decompilation of Dan's code, though I'm not sure if things will ever get that organized (especially since I don't really know what I'm doing yet).

(On that note, I'm planning on looking at other decomp repositories to find a way to upload my progress in Ghidra in a way that doesn't leak the game ROM)


I'll probably also add some miscellaneous things here and there (like the Panoots crunchy sound file maker), since there's not really any other main spot online for Dan trivia/funnies to collect.
